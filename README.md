## General Information

### Introdution

A docker-compose file to run multiple instances of pihole in your docker swarm 

Today we use the internet with countless connections, datatransfers and trackings in the
background we donÂ´t need and want. A great solution to keep this things out of your
network is the dns filter pihole. (Visit the project page )(https://pi-hole.net/) 

I was using pihole in a dockercontainer on a pi3 for a long time. One day the pi died while
i was not at home. The pi was the only dns server in our lan, so the family went offline 
and i was responsible. Singel point of failure

To prevent us from this happening again, we need redundance with a second instance of pihole.

Since a short time some raspi pis in my lan are assembled as a [docker swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)
and i thought it would be nice to roll out two instances of pihole with docker stack

### Goal

* Always have 2 instances of pihole running for redundancy
* Promote both instances to the dhcp clients in the lan

### Alternatives

The Goal is reached too by simply running pihole with docker on each node

### Requirements

* working docker swarm setup
* port 53 not in use on the nodes that should run pihole 

### Setup

1.
 
Choose two nodes wich should be workers to run pihole and label each of them. 
Change the node names in this example to the names or ip addresses of your nodes: 

Node1:

    docker node update --label-add pihole=true pi1.my.lan

Node2: 

	docker node update --label-add pihole=true pi2.my.lan

It could take some time until the pihole dockerimage is loaded and startet.
Check the state of the service with:

	docker service ps pihole_pihole 

2.

Deploy 2 instances of pihole on your nodes:

	docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml pihole

3.

Open the pihole gui in your browser: http://IP-of-your-node:8000/admin/ and 
configure pihole to your needs. (e.g. add blocklists) 

Test the function of this node with a client by using the node-ip as dns-server-ip

4. 

Export your settings on the node with the export function under Settings/Teleporter
and import it at the same place on your second node.

5. 

Add both node-ips as dns-servers to your clients or add them as dhcp-option to your
dhcp-server (e.g. 6,192.168.0.10,192.168.0.20)
